Currently, the California DMV website only offers [practice knowledge tests](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-education-and-safety/educational-materials/sample-driver-license-dl-knowledge-tests/) in English, Spanish, and ASL. My grandma wanted to study for her senior license renewal test, but she couldn't find any official practice questions in Chinese. While I found a [website with practice questions](https://pass-dmv-test.com/quiz-1-zh.html), my grandma was frustrated with the site because she kept clicking on extraneous pop-ups and links. 

As I wanted to both help my grandma and learn how to use React, I developed and designed a React App that allowed my grandma to study the scraped practice questions on an intuitive interface. Amidst her user testing, I continuously implemented her feedback and additional features to facilitate her learning. She passed the test a few weeks later!
